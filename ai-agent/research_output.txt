JSON Web Token (JWT) is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are designed to be compact, URL-safe, and usable, especially in a web-browser single-sign-on (SSO) context. JWT claims can typically be used to assert information about the user and potentially about the user's permissions.
